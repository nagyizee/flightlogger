	Flight Logger
Electronic judge for airplane model competitions

Input data:
Altitude, using barometer sensor
Start and finish impulses, using accelerometer sensor
Temperature
Onboard system and servo voltage

Logged in external flash memory with different sample rates based on physical variation rate of each sensor in real time.
Sensor fusion for calculation of flight time.
Blutooth communication planned for logistic handling of device during competitions.
